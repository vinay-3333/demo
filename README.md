- we will be predicting the ad click-through rate using the machine learning approch

<h2> > ‚úí Probelm statement </h2>
- Develop a machine learning algorithm that predict a particular user will click on an advertisment.

<h2> üìÇ Dataset </h2>

- Dataset consist 10 attributes
- **`Daily Time Spend on Site`,`Age`,`Area Income`,`Daily internet usage`,`Ad topic line`,`City`,`Gender`,`Country`,`Timestamp` and `Clicked on Ad`**
- **`Clicked on Ad` is output attribute and rest 9 input attributes those are accuretly to predict user will click on ad or not**

<h3> üîç Meta information about Dataset attributes</h3>

- **`Country`** User belong from which country
- **`Clicked on Ad`** There assign (0 or 1) user click or not on advertisment


<h3> Issues with Dataset and Solution </h3>

1. Dirty Data
- **`Daily Time Spent on Site->`** 
    - Zero null value
    - Convert datatype into float32
    - Not Normal Distribution

- **`Age`**
    - Zero null value
    - Convert datatype into int32
    - Almost Normal Ditribution

- **`Area Income`**
    - Zero null value
    - almost normal distribution

- **`Daily Internet Usage`**
    - Zero null value
    - almost normal distribution
    
- **`Ad Topic Line`**
    - Zero null value
    - there is 50 sub categores more dominate to other sub categories `Imbalanced Ad topic line attribute`
    
- **`Gender`**
    - zero null value
    - `53.76%` Female and `46.24%` Male `Balanced gender Attribute`

- **`Click on Ad`**
    - Zero null value
    - `50.83%` -> 0 and `49.17%` -> 1 `balanced click on ad attribute`


2. Messay Data

- **`Transformation and scaling`**
    - **`Daily Time Spent on Site`,`Age`,`Area of Income`,`Daily Internet Usage`:-** we apply here Scaling or Transformatkion
